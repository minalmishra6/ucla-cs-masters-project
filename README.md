Understanding the Monkeypox Discourse on Twitter using Topic Modeling:  
Experiments with BERTopic and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Modeling Techniques
===

Abstract
---

Monkeypox is a viral disease that is rapidly spreading across different parts of the world. However, the current outbreak can be controlled substantially by raising awareness in people about the disease, especially the aspects of the disease that are debated the most by people. We hereby present an analysis of the social discourse around Monkeypox on Twitter between May 07, 2022 and July 23, 2022 using topic modelling to discover the topics most discussed by people on the social media platform. In order to perform topic modeling, we experiment with the BERTopic technique which uses the state-of-the-art transformers, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is a classic technique that has been widely used for topic modeling. We evaluate the results using topic coherence and human interpretation, and present a comparison between BERTopic and LDA. Experiments and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of BERTopic in extracting better quality topics over LDA. Finally, based on the interpretations of results, we find that the topics related to Monkeypox that are commonly discussed by people on Twitter can be broadly classified under categories, namely news and global impact of Monkeypox, comparison of Monkeypox with other diseases, transmission of Monkeypox, Monkeypox cases at several locations, and precautions against Monkeypox.
